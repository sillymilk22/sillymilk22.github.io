        <h1>Animation</h1>
        <p>4/1/2024</p>
        <p>No song of day: same day</p>
        <p>
            I am now learning how to properly animate my silly, Im not very good at 3D
            Animation as well I have never had to do it before, But im learning.
            Using this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBJp82tlR3M" target="_blank">Youtube tutoral</a>
            again I have learned about the "Graph Editor", and on accident I learned how to use different "interpolation modes" and "easing modes".
            <br>
            The plan for the wave animation is that the silly will do a jump, mid air shifting to the waving pose and land. The waving pose being
            it balencing on one leg and waving.
            <br>
            Interpolation and Easing modes come in handy here where In my animation I must iminate physics. Im no physics expert but the silly should slow down
            (losing energy) and it goes higher in its jump, Then slowly gain energy again while falling. Using interpolation and easing modes we can achive this.
            By making the silly slow down then speed up thoughout the jump.

        </p>
        <p>
            To really bring the silly to life I will have it change facial expressions throughout the animations
            This is done by using a color mix with 3 different image textures, each containing a different emotion.
            , Keyframes are set to set the mix from 0 to 1 at different times, Changing the texture mid animation.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also following the tutuoral Added a value and 2 math nodes, So that I can easly switch
            Between Emotions using a single value. Currently 0 = Default 1 = Squinting 2 = Happy. This makes it easier
            To keyframe the emotions
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also started drafting how I want the wave animation to go, Using some sort of 5 Panel
            To plan it.

        <p>
            On my home page I want the silly to be able to move, To do this I will have to animate the silly.
            To do this I am following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBJp82tlR3M" target="_blank">Youtube Tutoral</a>
            Learning how to use animation in blender I have made a basic wave animation, This one was just for practice and I probably wont use it in the final
            I would love to make a much more fast paced jumpy animation for the silly, Where it kinda fastly snaps into different positions, with some movement between
            <br><br>
            We see tommrow it might not look good...

        <h1>Weight Painting</h1>
        <p>1/1/2024 (Happy new year !!)</p>
        <p>Song of the day <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgKxYnTEN5Y&t=139" target="_blank">In Affliction</a> by Yakui the Maid</p>
        <p>
            Small update today as I have to attent 2 birthday partys, Crazy! Using this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZjcFW3BRY&t=583s" target="_blank">Youtube tutoral</a> again I have learned how to weight paint
            This allows me to set what textures and vertexes are automaticly adjusted when posing. 
            For me whos making a low poly model this is quite helpful, As my arms move seperatly to the rest of the model, Just like the old PSX games.
            <br><br>
            Also I will now start including a song of the day for each blog post, This was the song i listend to the most while making the update!

        <h1>Bones and Rigging</h1>
        <p>31/12/2023</p>
        <p>
            I feel as if the bones should have been done before the PSX effects and stuff, But
            never mind. My workflow is funny because im doing this for fun.
            <br>
            I wish for the silly to be animated when the user loads this website. To do this I will have
            to give it animation and to do that I need to give the silly bones, or "Armatures" as blenders 
            seems to call it. I am doing this following this
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dZjcFW3BRY" target="_blank">Youtube tutoral</a>.
             <br><br>
             This was helpful but did not work for my case, When i posed it made the silly look all messy, eg streching
             textures and the hair not moving, When i did try to attach the hair the hair became deformed.
             I needed a much more "manual" way of attaching the bones. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srpOeu9UUBU">Youtube tutoral</a>
             I learned a more manual way of doing it by using "Pose Mode" to select indivual bones and attach them to spesific parts only.
             This allowed for the arms to strech the body less, and the hair to remain the same by attaching to only the head bone.
             The silly should now be ready for some animation. I will continue in the next blog post

        <h1>PSX effects and tricks</h1>
        <p>22/12/2023 - 23/12/2023</p>
        <p>
            Building this website so far I have been aiming for a sort of old net style. Decorating the website with old hardware and pixelated graphics.
            This silly should reflect that, and so far that is what I have done using low poly modeling and pixelated unfiltered textures. However there is still
            more I can do.
            In blender it is possible to replicate old graphics using a few tricks. I'm no expert on old graphics, Nor am I old enough to even have experenced those
            retro games and consoles but I think I know enough to attempt to replicate old graphics.
            <br><br>
            <b>Disabiling anti-aliasing</b> was one trick used. I learned how to do this from this <a href="https://youtu.be/kTleHWZkUaM" target="_blank">youtube tutoral</a>
            This disables the computer from attempting to make edges smooth by bluring them. Which in old consoles, was simply not possible.
            <br><br><b>Pixelating the rendering</b> was another trick I used which I got from this <a href="https://youtu.be/Gf5KP5ugLrA?t=197" target="_blank">youtube tutoral</a>. This is done
            by downscaling the resolution, Pixelating it then upscailing the resolution back to normal
            <br><br>
            <b>Vertex Snapping</b> is another trick I used, This one is quite complicated and I can't really describe it in words. But I got it from this <a href="https://youtu.be/zre96zn0t80" target="_blank">youtube tutoral</a>
            <br>This one is alot more experimental and I am unsure as to if i will keep it in the final product. Its also somewhat hard to notice with the pixelating of the graphics.
        </p>

        <h1>Texturing</h1>
        <p>20/12/2023 - 23/12/2023</p>
        <p>
            Following each object that had been UV mapped I then added some texture. This was done in both <b>Clip sutdio paint</b> and <b>Blenders texture editor</b>.
            Theres not much too texture, Its just taking what I have done in the 2D drawings of the silly and putting it on the model. One notable thing I that took
            a while to figure out was disabling anti-aliasing to give a pixel look, This can be seen in <b>The Silly 3D Model: Day 3</b>.
            <br><br>
            In <a href="https://youtu.be/7s7uSx18DUc?t=68" target="_blank">This youtube tutoral</a> Garbaj said a trick he uses if bluring out the pixelated texture, This is somthing
            I could experiment with in the finishing touches of the model to make the textures look nicer. I won't use it if starts ruining the style I'm going for however.

        <h1>UV Mapping</h1>
        <p>15/12/2023 - 21/12/2023 (i think)</p>
        <p>
            This was the first time I have had to UV map Properly. The body was simple due to the simple geometry, I was able to just use blenders <b>Project from View</b> feature
            For most mapping, With a view configuring.
            <br><b>However</b> when it came to the arms it was much more difficult, I think it achualy took me days to make that UV map because I had to learn how to Properly
            make a UV map and not just project from view. I used pixel texture featured in this <a href="https://youtu.be/RQVAUaSUP-k?t=462" target="_blank">Youtube tutoral</a>
            and pretty much ignored the rest :p. This was pretty dumb as there are a few tools i think would have been useful in that tutoral. In another 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/7JUNlj6mR0U?t=333" target="_blank">Youtube tutoral</a> I learned that when unwrapping a UV you need to think of it like cutting parts of a 
            3D object, Like a can so it can lay down flat. You can do the cutting using "Seams", From this point onwards I started using seams to sperate complex parts of my objects.
            I also learnt from a friend of mine Who for privacy reasons im just gonna name miggle, How to stich textures toghether, Allowing me to stick my corrected UV "Quads" toghether. 
            <br><br>
            For the arms and the hair this took a rediculous ammount of time and im sure there is a much more efficent way, But the manual adjusting seemed to just work.
            <br>
            Somewhere down the line I learned how to snap the UV Verts to a pixel perfect grid, I don't remember where I learned this but it was very helpful. 
            This <a href="https://youtu.be/RQVAUaSUP-k?t=864" target="_blank">Youtube tutoral again</a> pretty much coveres how to do it tho.

            <b>Whoops!</b><br>
            Yeah somewhere down the line i stopped recording my updates, that just happens sometimes where my motivation locks up, Maby I over worked myself.
            I still worked on the model while I was gone however so I will try to document in the next coming blog posts about everything I have done.

            <br><br>
            Internally the file strucuture for images has been redone, So images are now organized. This is not important for you viewers but its a change to the website

            Following some fixes with the model and ajusting the UV map to the model I can now start painting textures,
            I have gone for a 500x500 canvas size to give the silly's Texture a pixelated style.
            This was problematic to begin with because the texture would keep blurring whenever I applyed it.
            However following setting the rendering tab (A tab i didn't even know existed) to some settings
            I copyed from <a href="https://youtu.be/JmFvge8idzo?t=828" target="_blank">This Youtube Video</a> It appears to display
            the texture correctly. Now its time to just paint the texture. Blenders Texture Paint Tab kinda sucks and keeps
            drawing my face textures off center. It also lacks the proper brushes so I have decided to do the texturing
            in clipstudio paint, which has all the brushes I need :D
            <br>
            Its hair still needs to be fixed a little but I can work on that when i start doing the hair texture! Probably
            A bad workflow but I'm doing this for fun I dont care

            Currently I am learning to create this 3D model for the website!. This will be a 3D mascot for the website! I don't achualy know how to 3D model so it has taken me hours to make minimal progress. But I think im starting to get over the learning curve! 
            <br><br> These drawings purposly look kinda bad to make it easier to 3D model the creature.
